Note that if you provide a block, scan doesn't store the results up in an array
and return them; it sends each result to the block and then discards it. That
way, you can scan through long strings, doing something with the results along
the way, and avoid using up a lot of memory-saving substrings you've already
seen and used.

Using the notion of a pointer into the string, StringScanner lets you traverse
across the string as well as examine what's already been matched and what
remains. StringScanner is a useful complement to the built-in string scanning
facilities.

Enumerable#grep does a filtering operation from an enumerable object based on
the case equality operator (===), returning all the elements in the enumerable
that return a true value when threequaled against grep's argument. Thus if the
argument to grep is a regexp, the selection is based on pattern matches, as per
the behavior of Regexp#===:
